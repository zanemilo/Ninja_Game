### Purpose
<p>The purpose of this document is to serve in the tracking the progress of myself, Zane Deso, in completing daFluffyPotato pyGame Tutorial (2023) in 2024. I have hopes to learn much from this process and perhaps forming multifaceted toolset by the time I am an effective pyGame Dev. The general format will evolve with time and at this time due to constraints in time I will keep updates in Git. Please see past commits to development progress.
